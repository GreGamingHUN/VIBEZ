A Musicbot for Discord using the Discord.js NodeJS module

My main goal is to make a working musicbot with my fresh knowledge of Javascript.

To do:
- Stop Music
- Play Music on multiple servers at once

Features I want to make for the Bot:
- Website for the MusicBot (where you can edit music queue and add music in the queue)
- Android app for the MusicBot (where you can edit music queue and add music in the queue)

Modules used:
- Discord.JS
- play-dl
